# Grace Admin Panel

This is a flutter app to manage rotas for my church. It uses the supabase admin API. To adapt this for your own use you will need to create the appropriate tables, modify assets in the `assets/` directory and create a file in `lib/utils/constants.dart` to define the variables `anonKey` and `projectUrl`.
